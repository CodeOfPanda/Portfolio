      <Step title="Introduced to Programming">
        My boyfriend began to teach me what programming was and I vividly
        remember him showing me how you can code in the browser and make any
        website do whatever you want it to by editing elements in the DOM (i had
        no idea what that was at the time üòÅ)
      </Step>
      <Step title="First Laptop üíª">
        After being amazed by programming, I caught the bug and knew I needed to
        puruse it. I purchased my first laptop and this was the key start of my
        passion for tech, as it enabled me to actually write code!

      <Step title="Thailand ü•ã">
        After training hard for months, I made another leap and moved to

        <Step title="Started WGU üéä">
          Finally got to start school! I loved my first semester and took some
          great courses such as Software I (Java), Scripting & Programming
          (C++), Calculus I, Probability & Statistics, and Discrete Math I.
        </Step>
        <Step title="2nd Semester">
          After enjoying my first semester, I started back up again and took the
          following classes: Software II (Advanced Java), Data Structures &
          Algorithms I, Data Management (SQL), CompTIA Project+ certification,
          and ITIL 4 certification.

          <Step title="Second Time Betting On Myself">
            After falling in love with programming and spending countless nights
            learning, reading textbooks, and working on projects, I finally
            decided to stop training Muay Thai and quit all of my service jobs
            to go back to school and study computer science so I could
            eventually be a software engineer and write code for a career.
          </Step>
          <Step title="Preparing for College Round 2">
            I decided that I wanted to attend Western Governors University's
            Computer Science program as I had been having a lot of success and
            enjoyed self-teaching myself concepts online, and the program
            offered great coursework with the ability for me to work hard and
            accelerate.
          </Step>
          <Step title="Honing My Skills üî®">
            I wanted to make sure I would succeed at school, so I spent a couple
            months studying math through Khan Academy working my all the way
            through Calculus I & II to prepare for the program.
